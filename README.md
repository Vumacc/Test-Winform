# Info
Just made this as my firt winform in C#! I'd personally say it's pretty good for my first (Not like I have anything to compare it to)

**Note 1:** The semi-Windows 7 (but worse) style for this is intentional \
**Note 2:** May not include best practices

# Future releases
Probably not gonna support this as this was just a test to get a feel for this field. But still who knows?
